**Project Name: QuadValue Conquest (Java, Swing GUI)**

**Overview:**

QuadValue Conquest is a strategic two-player game developed in Java, utilizing Swing for its graphical user interface (GUI). The game is played on an n x n board, with selectable sizes of 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7. Each square on the board starts with a value of 0, and players take turns increasing these values. The goal is to convert squares to a value of 4, which then colors the square in the player's color (red or blue), earning them points. The game concludes when all squares reach the value of 4, and the player with the most colored squares wins.

**Features:**

- Dynamic board resizing to accommodate different game sizes.
- User-friendly GUI for interactive gameplay.
- Implementation of object-oriented principles to structure the game logic and interface components.
- Efficient event handling to link user actions with game logic.

**Technical Highlights:**

- Utilization of Java Swing for building a responsive and intuitive graphical user interface.
- Application of object-oriented design for modular, maintainable code.
- Strategy pattern for game mechanics, allowing for easy adaptation and expansion.
